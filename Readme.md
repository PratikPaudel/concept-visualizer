# üß† AI Concept Visualizer

> **Turn any concept into an interactive, personalized learning experience ‚Äî powered by AI.**

## üöÄ What is this?

**AI Concept Visualizer** is an experimental platform that uses AI to generate real-time visual explanations for complex topics. From binary search to the water cycle, this system transforms abstract ideas into **interactive diagrams**, **live code-based simulations**, and **adaptive quizzes** ‚Äî in seconds.

We‚Äôre not digitizing textbooks.  
We‚Äôre building a new way to understand the universe.

## üéØ Why This Matters

> ‚ÄúWhat if you could *learn anything* 10x faster with the help of an infinitely patient, personalized, interactive tutor?‚Äù

Education hasn‚Äôt evolved much since the printing press.  
This project is our rebellion.

## üìÅ Project Structure

    A[Frontend UI HTML/CSS/JS] -->|POST /visualize| B[FastAPI Endpoint]

    D --> E[Structured JSON Visualization Plan]
    E --> F[Return to Frontend]
    F --> G[Display boxes, arrows, interactions]
```

‚úÖ What We‚Äôve Built So Far
1. Backend Architecture (Python + FastAPI)
API Endpoint: /visualize ‚Äì Accepts a concept string and returns a categorized, structured visualization plan.

Routing Layer:

Receives a POST request with a JSON body: {"concept": "binary search"}

Triggers classification ‚Üí visualization plan generation ‚Üí response packaging.

LLM Integration:

Using OpenAI's openai Python SDK.
OpenAI Calls:

Step 1: Classification ‚Äì Ask GPT to classify the concept into 1 of 15 predefined categories.

Step 2: Visualization Generation ‚Äì Based on the category, use a tailored prompt to generate a JSON plan.

Category Prompt Mapping:

CATEGORY_PROMPTS dictionary maps 15 academic categories to rich prompts.

Prompts specify expected JSON fields like title, description, elements, interactions, and htmlTips.

2. Data Model Structure (Pydantic)
ConceptRequest: accepts a single field concept: str.

VisualizationElement: each element has label, type, position, description.

VisualizationPlan: includes title, layout, interaction, elements.

ConceptResponse: returns category and the above visualization object.

3. Error Handling & Parsing
Logs each step (classification, prompt, parsing).

Attempts to parse OpenAI output to JSON.

If parsing fails, returns a raw response for debugging.

üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details Recap
Input: "binary search"

Output:
{
  "concept": "binary search",
  "category": "Computer Science & Technology",
  "visualization": {
    "title": "Binary Search",
    "description": "A divide-and-conquer algorithm...",
    "layout": "Horizontal array with moving pointers...",
    "interaction": "Pointer movement, animation step-by-step",
    "elements": [
      { "label": "Array", "type": "box", "position": "center", "description": "Sorted list of numbers" },
      ...
    ],
    "htmlTips": "Use JS to animate pointer movement and comparisons"
  }
}
Backend Files:

models/concept.py: Schema definitions.

api/routes.py: API logic, request handler.

utils/llm_utils.py or equivalent: GPT prompt formatting and parsing logic.

üî≠ Planned Improvements
üì¶ Backend:
Improve handling of malformed GPT output (e.g., incomplete JSON).
Add logging, error tags, and timestamps for easier debugging.

üé® Frontend (coming soon):
Render HTML/CSS/JS-based visualizations from the structured JSON.
Animate interactions: clicking, slider input, step transitions.
Show loading progress and allow retry/fallback if model fails.
